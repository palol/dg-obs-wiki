		"content": "[!FAQ] Configuring build pipelines\nFor changing the markdown rendering or build pipeline see <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/advanced/configure-build-pipeline/\">Configure build pipeline</a>\n\nRelease 1.39.0 of the template introduced a new way to add custom components to your site. Previously, any customization done in the template would be overwritten whenever you <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/06-updating-the-template/\">updated the template</a>, making it hard to maintain if you wanted the latest update.\nThe template now has the concept of slots, where you can add any content you want. Be it Javascript, HTML or CSS.\nAvailable slots\nNotes\nNamespaces\nThese are the namespaces currently supported for notes:\n\ncommon\n\nWill be added on both the home page and all note pages\n\nindex\n\nWill be added on the home page\n\nnotes\n\nWill be added to alle note pages\n\nSlots\nThese are the supported slots:\n\nhead\n\nWill be placed inside the html &lt;head&gt; tag\n\nheader\n\nWill be placed on top of the page, in the &lt;header&gt; tag, after tags and note title if that is enabled\n\nbeforeContent\n\nWill be placed just before the page content\n\nafterContent\n\nWill be placed just after the page content\n\nfooter\n\nWill be placed in the footer of the page\n\nFiletree\nNamespaces\n\nfiletree\n\nSlots\n\nbeforeTitle\nafterTitle\n\nSidebar\nNamespaces\n\nfiletree\n\nSlots\n\ntop\nbottom\n\nHow does it work?\nThe files should be placed using the following format:\nsrc/site/_includes/components/user/&lt;namespace&gt;/&lt;slot&gt;/&lt;filename&gt;.njk\n\nThe components are written in Nunjuck, a templating language for HTML and Javascript. Don't worry if you don't know it. You don't have to use any of the features. Simply writing vanilla HTML will work. If you want to add a script, be sure to add it inside a script tag:\n&lt;script&gt;\n\tconsole.log(&quot;hello&quot;)\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThe important thing is that the file extension used is &quot;njk&quot;.\nIf you don't want to inline your scripts, but have them in a separate js file, you can put them in the src/site/scripts folder. They can then be referenced like this in your njk file:\n&lt;script src=&quot;/scripts/your-script.js&quot; /&gt;\n\nExamples\nFor example to add common content in every pages header right after the title and tags the file should be placed in the following directory:\nsrc/site/_includes/components/user/common/header/\n\nSay, you have a comment system implemented in a file (e.g. comment.njk) and you want to use that only in notes pages, put it in the following path:\nsrc/site/_includes/components/user/notes/footer/comment.njk\n\nCustom user data\nIf you want to compute some data in any of your custom *.njk files, you can modify the src/helpers/userUtils.js file. If you have the latest version of the template, it should look like this:\n// Put your computations here.\n\nfunction userComputed(data) {\nreturn {};\n}\n\nexports.userComputed = userComputed;\n\nAny properties added to the object return in the userComputed function, will be available to use in your *.njk files. As an example, the following userUtils.js file:\n// Put your computations here.\n\nfunction userComputed(data) {\nreturn {\n\t city: 'Bergen',\n\t weather: [&quot;rain&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;, &quot;rain&quot;]\n};\n}\n\nexports.userComputed = userComputed;\n\n..should make the city and weather property availble in your templates like so:\n\nDynamic CSS/SCSS\n\nDynamic CSS/SCSS\nAny css/scss files placed under src/site/styles/user will automatically be linked into the head right after all other styling. Meaning that the styling added here will take presedence over everything else.\n\n[!info] File order\nRemember that, the paths for a given slot are always sorted by filename. Therefore, if order matters, you should name files such they maintain the alphabetical order.\n\nExamples in the wild\nTo get started and see a live example, take a look at GitHub user uroybd 's garden, topobon . He uses components to add a theme switcher and a disqus comment section among other things. You can take a look at how he's implemented it here",

If your changes css changes doesn't reflect on your site, try adding an !important behind it and see if that helps.\n\n[!warning] Deprecated\nPreviously the only way to add custom styling to the site was to add styling to the custom-styles.scss file.

		"content": "Pros\nOne of the main differences between this plugin and other popular digital gardens is that it integrates with Obsidian via a plugin. Disregarding the initial setup, you'll never have to touch Git. (Unless you want to.) Publishing a new note is as simple as using the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/02-commands/#publish-single-note\">publish single note command</a>.\nThis also makes it much easier to only publish some of your notes, instead of your entire vault to your digital garden.\nOther advantages with integrating so tightly with obsidian is that we can take advantage of the incredible plugins and themes from the community of Obsidian. So far this plugin supports obsidian specific features like Dataview Queries, Excalidraw and Obisidian themes.\nBecause of the various customization options, you can also use it as a simple notesharing solution, creating links to your notes to easily share them with friends and colleagues. No need to enable all the bells and whistles like backlinks, search and graphs if you don't need them.\nCons\nThe downside of this tight coupling with Obsidian is of course that this garden isn't as easy to integrate with other writing tools than Obsidian, as some of the other gardens is.\nBut if you'll ever decide to switch to another tool, all your files are still available as plain text, so switching shouldn't be too hard.",

These will be called after all the default setup has been processed, and allows you to do modifications on both the eleventy config and the markdown-it instance.

		"url":"/advanced/note-specific-settings/",
		"content": "Title\nIf you want to use a custom page title instead of the name of your note, you can use the &quot;title&quot; attribute in frontmatter. This allows you to use characters that are not allowed to use in filenames. (Ex: &quot;:&quot;, &quot;/&quot;, &quot;|&quot;)\n---\ndg-publish: true\ntitle: &quot;My Custom Title&quot;\n---\n\nCustom Links\nThis plugin supports setting custom links to a note, if you prefer something else than the default behaviour. This is done by adding a dg-permalink attribute to the frontmatter of your file. As an example, the top of your file could look like this:\n---\ndg-publish: true\ndg-permalink: &quot;mynote&quot;\n---\n\nThis will make the URL to you note be &quot;{Your-Garden-Name}.netlify.app/mynote/&quot;. You can still use normal obsidian links as before to link to it. These will be automatically corrected once you publish a note with the permalink attribute. Same goes for deleting the attribute. Doing so will result in the note using the default URL. All links in other notes should automatically be corrected and still work.\nThe permalinks can be an arbitrary level of folders deep, such as:\n---\ndg-permalink: &quot;category/2022/mynote/&quot;\n---\n\nFile path\nIf you want your note to appear in a different file structure than what you have in your vault, you can use the dg-path attribute, like so:\n---\ndg-path: &quot;Advanced/Features.md&quot;\n---\n\nMore details about this is available in <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/05-other-settings/#rewrite-path-for-single-note\">05 Other Settings#Rewrite path for single note.</a>\n\nPinning notes to filetree\nIf you want certain notes to be at the top of the folder its in, you can use the dg-pinned attribute. Setting this to true will make the note be on top of the folder it is currently in\n---\ndg-pinned: true\n---\n\nHide file from file tree\nIf you want to hide a note from the filetree, you can do so by setting dg-hide to true.\n---\ndg-hide: true\n---\n\nHide note from graph\nIf you want to hide a note from the graph view, you can do so by setting dg-hide to true.\n---\ndg-hide-in-graph: true\n---\n\nMetatags\nSetting metatags for a note can be done by adding a dg-metatags attribute like so:\ndg-metatags:\ndescription: &quot;some description&quot;\n&quot;og:image&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/someimage.png&quot;\n\nNote that there is a single space before the &quot;description&quot; field, not a tab.\nThis feature can be used if you want custom titles and images when sharing links in social media. Using the example below will add a title and an image that will be used when sharing the link in social media.\ndg-metatags:\n&quot;og:title&quot;: &quot;Title Appearing on Social Media Site&quot;\n&quot;og:image&quot;: &quot;https://example.com/someimage.png&quot;\n\nRead more about the Open Graph Protocol\n\nBody classes\nYou can set custom classes to the body tag for your published notes, by using the 'dg-content-classes' attribute.\ndg-content-classes: cards\n\nThis will add a &quot;cards&quot; class to your note, allowing you to customize each note with specific classes.\nYou can also change the frontmatter key used to specify this in <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/04-appearance-settings/#css-settings\">the appearance settings</a>. So, for example, if you are using Minimal Theme's cssClasses you can change the key to 'cssClasses', meaning you don't have to specify the classes twice.\n\nNote Icons\nEach note can have an assosiated note icon. By default this is set by the\ndg-note-icon property, but this can be changed in the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/04-appearance-settings/#note-icon-settings\">note icon settings</a>.\nBy default the plugin provides 4 options: default, 1, 2, and 3.\nThe provided icons looks like this:\nDefault\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nChanging and adding icons\nYou can change and add your own icons the following way:\nThe ideal way to change the default icons is by adding the svgs in the img folder and setting the appropriate css vars in body in a <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/advanced/adding-custom-components/#dynamic-css-scss\">custom css file</a>:\nbody {\n--note-icon-1: url(/img/your-custom.svg);\n--note-icon-2: url(/img/tree-2.svg);\n--note-icon-3: url(/img/tree-3.svg);\n--note-icon-fallback: url(/img/default-note-icon.svg);}\n}\n\nTo add new icons, let's say, for 'stone', add a snippet like this (and add the relevant svg) in a <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/advanced/adding-custom-components/#dynamic-css-scss\">custom css file</a>:\nbody.title-note-icon .cm-s-obsidian &gt; header &gt; h1[data-note-icon=&quot;stone&quot;]::before,\nbody.filetree-note-icon .filename[data-note-icon=&quot;stone&quot;]::before,\nbody.links-note-icon .internal-link[data-note-icon=&quot;stone&quot;]::before,\nbody.backlinks-note-icon .backlink[data-note-icon=&quot;stone&quot;]::before {\nbackground-image: url(/img/stone.svg);\n}",

It will then be published as a standalone note, with only the excalidrawing showing.\n\nMark multiple notes with dg-publish\nThe plugin itself doesn't provide any easy way to mark multiple notes at once with the dg-publish attribute. However you can make use of a plugin like MetaEdit which has many features designed for exactly this.\n\nAutomatically add publish flag to note when adding note to folder\nSome people have requested functionality for publishing all notes in a given folder. To do this, you can combine this plugin with the Templater plugin to create folders which will automatically use a template having the dg-publish attribute set. Thanks to vanadium23 for sharing this tip.\n\nRender HTML\nIf you write any HTML in your notes, they will be rendered in the garden. This means you can create custom &quot;website-like&quot; component on your site. As an example, the grid rendered in <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/#sites-people-have-created\">Digital Garden - Publish Obsidian Notes For Free#Sites people have created</a> was created using divs and image tags with some custom inline styling.\n&lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; align-items: center; justify-content: center;&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center;align-items:center;&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;img style=&quot;padding: 10px&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dix4ngy25/image/upload/c_scale,r_8,w_300/v1668068263/dgdocs/CleanShot_2022-11-10_at_09.17.28_2x.png&quot;/&gt;\n\t\t&lt;a href=&quot;https://notes.thatother.dev/&quot;&gt;That Other Dev&lt;/a&gt;\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t&lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; flex-direction: column; justify-content: center;align-items: center&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;img style=&quot;padding: 10px&quot; src=&quot;https://res.cloudinary.com/dix4ngy25/image/upload/c_scale,r_8,w_300/v1668068103/dgdocs/CleanShot_2022-11-10_at_09.14.47_2x.png&quot;/&gt;\n\t\t&lt;a href=&quot;https://syleria.netlify.app/&quot;&gt;Syleria&lt;/a&gt;\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nNote that the HTML cannot have any empty newlines between the opening tag and closing tag. This will cause some of the HTML to be printed instead of rendered\nButtons\nIf you want to render buttons on your site, you can either do it the markdown way, with an SVG, or just create a html button.\nSVG Button\n[&lt;img style=&quot;float:left&quot; src=&quot;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14358394/115450238-f39e8100-a21b-11eb-89d0-fa4b82cdbce8.png&quot; width=&quot;200&quot;&gt;](https://ko-fi.com/oleeskild)\n\nwill result in\n\nHTML Button\n&lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; justify-content: center; cursor:pointer;&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden/issues/55&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;button&gt;Submit your site&lt;/button&gt;\n\t&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nwill result in\n\n\t\n\t\tSubmit your site\n\t\n\nStyled HTML button\n&lt;div style=&quot;display: flex; justify-content: center; cursor: pointer;&quot;&gt;\n\t&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden/issues/55&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;\n\t\t&lt;button style=&quot; font-size: 28px; padding: 10px; height: fit-content; margin-top: 50px; background: var(--text-accent); font-weight: 600; color: var(--text-on-accent); &quot;&gt;\n\t\t\tSubmit your digital garden site\n\t\t&lt;/button&gt;\n\t&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nwill result in\n\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\tSubmit your digital garden site\n\t\t\n\t\n\nImage heavy sites\nThe plugin in it's current form is not optimized for image-heavy sites. A couple of images in your notes should be just fine, but if you embed 10s or 100s of large image files in one note, you will run into some performance issues.\nThe note will load slowly, and you can get an error from GitHub when trying to publish, due to the size of the note.\nThere is a workaround. If your notes has a lot of images, upload them to a cloud storage and embed them with the ![image text](https://image.url) syntax in your notes. You should then see a significant speed boost.\nThis can even be automated by using a plugin like the Obsidian Imgur Plugin, which will automatically upload pasted images to imgur and embed them in your note.\n\nAdding analytics to Vercel\nIf you are using Vercel to host your site, you can add basic analytics to your site by following the instructions described here\n\nDisable auto detection of URLs\nThe garden will automatically find text that looks like URLs and make them clickable automatically. If, for some reason, you do not want that you can follow the instructions given in this comment to turn it off.",

By adding your URL to the plugin settings, the sitemap should automatically be generated using that value.\n\nAtom/RSS feed\nThe site automatically generates an Atom/RSS feed available at /feed.xml on your site. In order for this to be generated you need to add your Base URL in the settings, like in the image above.\nFor the dates to work properly, you need to enable the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/04-appearance-settings/#timestamps-settings\">Show updated timestamp</a> setting under the plugin's Appearance settings. If this is not enabled, the feed will use the last date the site was built, which in practice means the last date you last published anything to the site.\n\nFootnote source\n[^1]: Here are some extra information in a footnote\n\nHere are some extra information in a footnote ↩︎",

		"content": "The initial setup takes a couple of minutes, but when you're done you'll have a digital garden in which you are in control of every part of it, and can customize it as you see fit. Which is what makes digital gardens so delightful.\n\nDownload and install the community plugin Digital Garden in Obsidian.\n\nNext, you will need a GitHub account. If you don't have this, create one here.\n\nYou'll also need a Vercel account. You can sign up using your GitHub account here\n\nOpen this repo, and click the blue &quot;Deploy to Vercel&quot; button.\n\nThis should open Vercel and create a copy of this repository in your GitHub accont. Give it a fitting name like 'my-digital-garden'. Follow the steps in Vercel to publish your site to the internet.\n\nNext you need to create an access token to your GitHub Account. This acts as a sort of password so that the plugin can add new notes to your GitHub repository on your behalf. Go to this page while logged in to GitHub. The correct settings should already be applied. (If you don't want to generate this every few months, choose the &quot;No expiration&quot; option.) Click the &quot;Generate token&quot; button, and copy the token you are presented with on the next page.\n\n[!tip] A more secure option\nGitHub has recently launced a new beta feature, where you can target what repositories the token has access to. This is currently the most secure way to use the plugin. See <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/advanced/fine-grained-access-token/\">Fine grained access token</a> for details on how to generate this.\n\nOpen Obsidian and the settings for &quot;Digital Garden&quot; and fill in your GitHub username, the name of the repo with your notes which you created in step 3, and lastly paste in your token.\n\nNow, let's publish your first note! Create a new note in Obsidian. Now add two new properties to the note.\n\n[!tip]- Help! How do I add a property to a note\nProperties was added in Obsidian in version 4.1\nTo add a property to a note, you have several options:\n\nUse the Add file property command.\nUse the Cmd/Ctrl+; hotkey.\nChoose Add file property from the More actions menu (three dots icon) or right-clicking the tab.\nType --- at the very beginning of a file.\n\nA checkbox named dg-publish\nA checkbox named dg-home\nToggle both checkboxes so that they are in the checked state.\nIt should look something like this:\n\nThis does two things:\n\nThe dg-home setting tells the plugin that this should be your home page or entry into your digital garden. (It only needs to be added to one note, not every note you'll publish).\n\nThe dg-publish setting tells the plugin that this note should be published to your digital garden. Notes without this setting will not be published. (In other terms: Every note you publish will need this property.)\n\nOpen your command pallete by pressing CTRL+P on Windows/Linux (CMD+P on Mac) and find the &quot;Digital Garden: Publish Single Note&quot; command. Press enter.\n\nGo to your site's URL which you should find on Vercel. If nothing shows up yet, wait a minute and refresh. Your note should now appear.\n\nCongratulations, you now have your own personal part of the internet in the form of a digital garden, for free 🎉.\nYou can now start adding links as you usually would in Obisidan, with double square brackets, to the note that you just published.\nRemember to also publish the notes your are linking to as this will not happen automatically. This is by design. You are always in control of what notes you actually want to publish. If you did not publish a linked note, the link will simply lead to a site telling the user that this note does not exist.\nIf you want to unpublish a note, without deleting the note from your vault, simply uncheck or remove the dg-publish property in the note, open the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/02-commands/#open-publication-center\">publication center</a> and click the &quot;Delete notes from garden&quot; button.\nNow that you are up and running, you can take a look at the available <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/02-commands/\">commands</a> or the various available <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/03-note-settings/\">note settings</a>.

But the plugin also support features like backlinks, local graph and search.\nAll such settings are available in the &quot;Note Settings&quot; dialog.

The settings set here are the global default settings used for each published note. If you want more granular control, and disable or enable some features for some particular notes, you can do this via front matter. All the settings has the frontmatter/<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/01-getting-started/#ad515c\">properties</a> equivalence written in parentheses behind the settings.\nSo if you have enabled the search globally, but have one note where you want to disable this, you can do so by setting the dg-enable-search to false:\ndg-publish: true\ndg-enable-search: false\n\nOr the other way around: If you have disabled the graph globally, but have a note where you want it to show, you can set the dg-show-local-graph to true.\ndg-publish: true\ndg-show-local-graph: true\n\n[!note] Obsidian properties\nAfter introducing properties, Obsidian doesn't explicitly put the necessary &quot;false&quot; value on checkbox properties when they aren't checked. For now you'll need to use properties as text types when wanting to disable settings on a specific note. For example, the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/example-pages/simple-page/\">Simple Page</a> note's properties looks like this:\n\nAvailable settings\n\nShow home link\nOn by default. If this is turned on, a navbar will show at the top of each note. The site name will be displayed as a header, and can be clicked on. Clicking on it will take the user back to the home note. By default the site name is &quot;Digital Garden&quot;. This can be changed via the <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/04-appearance-settings/#sitename\">04 Appearance Settings#Sitename</a> settings.\n\nShow local graph for notes\nOff by default. When turned on a local graph, like the one in Obsidian, will be shown to the right. It will show both outgoing and incoming links to the current note. It is interactive, and can be moved around. Clicking one of the nodes will take you to the corresponding note.\nOn desktop it is shown to the right. On mobile it is shown in the bottom.\n\nShow a table of content for notes\nOff by default. When turned on, a list of all headers in your note will be shown to the right. Clicking one the headers will scroll to the corresponding header in the note.\nOn desktop it is shown to the right. On mobile it is hidden.\n\nShow backlinks for notes\nOff by default. When turned on, your published notes will display a list of notes linking back to it. It will only show notes that have been published.\nOn desktop and bigger screens it will be placed on the right. On mobile and smaller screens it is put on the bottom of the page.\n\nShow inline title\nOff by default. When turned on, the filename will be shown on the top of the page. Similar to the &quot;Show inline title&quot; setting introduced in Obsidian v1.0.\n\nShow filetree sidebar\nOff by default. When turned on, a sidebar will be shown to the right, with all your published notes displayed in the folder hierarchy they are placed in in Obsidian. On smaller screens it will disappear, but can be viewed by clicking the &quot;hamburger&quot; menu in the top left corner.\n\nLink preview\nOff by default. When turned on, all links will show a preview of the note content when you hover over them.\n\nEnable search\nOff by default. When enabled, users have the option to easily search through all your published notes. The searchbox can be viewed by clicking the search box that appears in the upper right corner, or on the top of the filetree sidebar if this is enabled. It can also be triggerd by pressing CTRL+K on Windows/Linux or CMD+K on MacOS.\nA dialog will pop up. The results can be navigated by using your keyboard using the up and down arrow keys. Pressing enter will take you to the note. Pressing ESC will close the search box.\nWhen search is enabled, you can also construct URLs that shows a search and the result. This is done by specifying a &quot;q&quot; query parameter in the URL.\nE.g. for this site: https://dg-docs.ole.dev/?q=Commands\n\nShow Tags\nOff by default. When turned on, any tags in your note's frontmatter will show at the top of the page, just under the note title.\nIf search is enabled, clicking on a tag will bring up the search box and show all notes with that tag.\n\nLet all frontmatter through\nOff by default. Most users want this turned off. This is a setting mainly for advanced users, who modifies their template and wants full control over what frontmatter is passed through to the template. By default all frontmatter properties not recognized by the plugin are stripped away before publishing. This is to prevent the build in Netlify from failing if there are data in the frontmatter not recognized by the static site generator. (See 11ty Front Matter Data for details on this). If you're site suddenly stopped working, and this is enabled, it is worth trying to disable it again.\n\nNote-specific settings\nThere are also some <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/advanced/note-specific-settings/\">Note Specific Settings</a> that are not in the &quot;Note Settings&quot; view.

Resulting in all notes getting an empty URL. If you've experienced this issue, disabling this setting should fix that.\n\nRewrite Paths\nIf you want your filepaths in the garden to differ from the vault path, you can add rewrite rules in the &quot;Path Rewrite Rules&quot; section. If, let's say, I want to change the Getting Started folder to instead be named &quot;Quick Start&quot; in the garden it would look like this:\n\nAfter adding this, all affected notes should show up as changed in the publication center, allowing you to update them.\n\n[!tip] Protip\nIf you want all your digital garden notes to be in a folder, say &quot;published&quot; in your vault, but appear under the root of your website you can use a rule on the form&quot;published:&quot;.

All notes under the folder &quot;published&quot; wil then appear on your website like &quot;example.com/mynote&quot;\n\nRewrite path for single note.\nYou can also change the note on a per note basis. Using dg-path in the frontmatter, you can change where a note should be located in the garden. This will overwrite any rules that may apply to that note.\nThe dg-path property needs the entire filepath you want. For example, if I wanted the &quot;Features&quot; note to instead be located under the &quot;Advanced&quot; folder in the garden I would add the following frontmatter to it:\n---\ndg-path: &quot;Advanced/Features.md&quot;\n---\n\nCustom filters\nIf you want any of your content to be modified before publishing the note, you can add a filter.\n\nFor example say you want to hide text that is inside a specific pattern:\nThis is some normal text.\n\n::: hidden\nThis is some private text that should not be published.\n:::\n\nYou could then add the following filter.\n:::hidden(.*\\n)*?:::\n\nIt also supports Regex groups, meaning you can use $1, $2 etc in the replacement string to insert the first and second regex group and so on.\n<a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/04-appearance-settings/\">&lt; Prev</a> | <a class=\"internal-link\" target=\"\" data-note-icon=\"\" href=\"/getting-started/06-updating-the-template/\">Next: Updating the template &gt;</a>",
